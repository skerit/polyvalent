## Introduction

This mod is a client-side companion for PolyMC. PolyMC allows servers to install mods, without the players requiring to install the same mods on their client.
(This works by using CustomModelData for items & unused block states for blocks, together with resource packs)

Polyvalent improves on that experience by making more things overridable through resource packs.

So the main idea is: your players only have to install 1 mod instead of a hundred.
