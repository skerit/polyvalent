## Introduction

This mod is a companion for PolyMC. PolyMC allows servers to install mods, without the players requiring to install the same mods on their client.
(This works by using CustomModelData for items & unused block states for blocks, together with resource packs)

Polyvalent improves on that experience by creating more dummy blockstates and items.
It is required to be installed on both the server & client.

Big thanks to [Patbox](https://github.com/patbox) for his [Polymer](https://github.com/patbox/polymer) project, which I used as a reference for the networking code.

## Current state

Polyvalent currently only implements new blockstates the server can use:

- Full blocks
- Slabs
- Transparent blocks
- Glowing blocks
